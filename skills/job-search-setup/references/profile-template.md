# Job Search Profile — Template

This is the shared profile for the Job Search Agent plugin. It lives at `job-search/profile.md` in the user's Cowork folder. Every skill in the plugin reads it: `find-jobs` uses the search section, `application-tracker` uses the strong-fit signals for scoring, and `interview-guide-engine` uses the background section.

Fill in what's known. Mark anything not yet captured as `(not set yet)` so other tools can tell the difference between "empty on purpose" and "not asked yet."

## Field notes for whoever fills this in

- **Target titles** should be the literal phrases that appear in postings. "Product Lead" and "Group PM" surface different results than "Product Manager." Capture all the user actually wants.
- **Strong-fit signals** drive the STRONG tier in scans and the score in the tracker. Keep them concrete.
- **Exclusions** do the heavy lifting in filtering. A precise skip list removes more noise than any keyword adds signal. The named-companies block list grows over time — append, don't replace.
- **Saved searches** are job-board URLs with filters applied. See `building-a-saved-search.md`.
- **Proof points** can be deferred to first interview-guide use if the user is in a hurry, but they make every fit read sharper, so capture them when you can.
